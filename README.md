# Ergonomic Posture Analysis and Recommendation System

## Project Overview

This project aims to enhance workplace ergonomics through the use of computer vision and machine learning. It has two main components:

### Posture Assessment and Ergonomic Recommendations

- A simple interface built using **Streamlit** allows users to upload a picture of themselves sitting at their desk.
- The project uses **Mediapipe** to analyze the posture patterns and identify any deviations from ergonomic standards.
- Based on ergonomic guidelines, the system provides personalized recommendations to adjust chair and desk heights to promote a healthier sitting posture.

### Neck Posture Detection Model

- A machine learning model is trained to recognize poor neck posture in real-time using webcam input.
- The system processes live images and detects if the user's neck posture deviates from the recommended ergonomic position.
- The ultimate goal is to notify users when they are exhibiting bad neck posture, prompting them to correct it and thus reduce the risk of strain or injury.
